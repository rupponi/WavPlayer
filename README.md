# WavPlayer

### Want to try a new music experience? This is my Java-based Music Player. Due to the lack of official Java support of mp3 playback, this player works around the issues through converting your mp3's to a temporary .wav file which will be played back with perfect clarity. Feel free to give it a shot!

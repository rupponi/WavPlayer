# WavPlayer

### Want to try a new music experience? This is my Java-based Music Player. Due to the lack of official Java support of mp3 playback, this player works around the issues through converting your mp3's to a temporary .wav file which will be played back with perfect clarity. Feel free to give it a shot!

## NOTES FOR SETUP:
#### After cloning, check to make sure these .jar files within the directory are included in the dependencies.

#### jave-1.0.2.jar
#### jmf-2.1.1e.jar

#### After this, make sure to set the file path of the file you want to play in the MP3Player source file where indicated. This is only temporary until integration with File Explorer is added.
